# Men-and-women-clothes-classification
In this project, I made a classifier that will be able to classify the men's and women's clothes by CNN I used Keras in this model and I was able to achieve good accuracy with all these categories, I was able to make 14 categories for men clothes and 15 for women "of course my team who collected the data" and finally you can see how much this project is accurate.

These models made by Spyder.
The data is so big it's more than 7000 photos so I will upload them soon on Kaggle.
